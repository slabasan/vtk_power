vtk_power/: Includes small isosurfacing vis application used for
doing power analysis studies on venus13 cluster with RAPL. The venus13 cluster
was packaged up to be shipped to SC13 in Denver on Friday, Nov 8, so it was
necessary to save working files and directories for continued research.

vtk_power.C: Isosurfacing application with 3 phases, creating data set,
isosurfacing, and normals. Change isovalue on lin 64 to affect how many
triangles are being created - a value of 0.2 and 0.5 should produce more
triangles than 0.01. The larger number of triangles produced, the more work
being done, and the result being larger power consumption.

Makefile: Makes two object files. vtk_power is an executable built with libmsr,
so we can analyze instantaneous power consumption. vtk_app is an executable
built with just MPI, so the program will run with no power readings.

vtk_power_runner: Runs the vtk_power executable. Must be run as root in order
to read msrs, otherwise will see lots of errors. 

scratch.c: Scratch application to test sleep command. Libmsr should be reading
the msrs every 1ms over a 100s sleep.

data_X.X.txt: All inclusive data files, where X.X is the isovalue determined in
vtk_power.C. Lines with RRR deal with power, so there is additional files with
RRR_X.X.txt, which are imported to R and plots are created (time on x-axis,
power consumption on y-axis).
